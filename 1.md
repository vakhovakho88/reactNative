## At the beginnning let us make a project not from scratch

* Unzip rn_master
* open Terminal and go to rn_master
* npm install here
* npm start
* it will install expo
* install expo app on your mobile device from google play store
* when expo is installed succesfully than react native bundler runs on: localhost:19002
* expo start is a commant to start expo  everytime
* npm start to start a server
* ctrl+c to stop a server
* we see QR-Code there and we can scan it from our app
* but we can see it from the camera too, expo will detect it automatically
* all bundles and javascripts will be installed and downloaded


##  folder structure (Allmost identicall as React js)

* `src -> screens -> Homescreen.js`  there ist only one component that says hi.
* Anytime we save anything it makes live reload

## GIT: https://github.com/StephenGrider/rn-casts


## Emulators
#### ios emulator cannot be running on windows

* react: how to work with components
* react-native : make to show this components on the mobile device
* babel translates jsx to js code
* babeljs.io translate jsx to javascript online

## Import/Export everything just like react js
## Only export from main component is different: `export default createAppContainer(navigator)`
## Thats why we need in main component to have:
```js
import { createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation';
import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';
```
    

## stacknavigtor is a liitle object that desides what object should be shown on the screen at a given point
```js
const navigator = createStackNavigator(
  {
    Home: HomeScreen,
    Components: ComponentsScreen,
    ExcerciseList: ExcerciseList
   
  },
  {
    //initialRouteName: "Home",
    //initialRouteName: "FirstApp",
    initialRouteName: "Home",
    defaultNavigationOptions: {
      title: "App"
    }
  }
);

```
* It means we have 3 screens (Components)
* And initial screen is "Home"


## rules of jsx:
- view  helps us to group elements
- just like div in react

## Class and functional component is just like in react js

## Some basic imports
```js
import React from 'react';
import {StyleSheet, Text, View, FlatList} from 'react-native';
```
* To have react
* To have native components
* To have styleshee
* In react native we have no css.
* In react native we hav no HTML tags

## Example of simple class component
```js

class TestComp extends Component{
    state = {
        persons:[
            {name:"vakho", key: "1"},
            {name:"vakho", key: "2"},
            {name:"vakho", key: "3"},
            {name:"vakho", key: "4"}
        ]
    }

    render(){
        let all = this.state.persons.map((person)=>{
            return <Text>{person.name}</Text>
        })

        return (
            <View>
               {all} 
            </View>
        )
    }
}
export default TestComp;

```
* View is just like div in html
* Text is a output text
* Mapping is same as in react


## Example of simple functional component with Styling too
```js
const MyFirstApp = ()=>{
    const name = "Vakho";
    return(
        <View style={{paddingLeft:10}}>
            <Text style={styles.text1Style}>Getting stassrted with react native!</Text>
            <Text style={styles.text2Style}> My name is {name}</Text>
        </View>
    );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    text1Style : {
        fontSize: 30
    },
    text2Style : {
        fontSize: 20
    }
})


export default MyFirstApp;

```

* We can have const variables inside a component too
* `style={{paddingLeft:10}}` inline styling, javascript object in javascript code
* `StyleSheet.create({whole style objects here})` create styling
*  `style={styles.text2Style}` assign styling
* `My name is {name}` call local variable
